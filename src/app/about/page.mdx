## About

I was born, raised, and currently live in NYC (Queens). I grew up learning the piano, tinkering with smartphones, building custom PCs, and playing video games.

In Fall 2018, I attended [Baruch College](https://baruch.cuny.edu) to study finance. I only stayed for one semester after realizing I didn't really have the passion for a career in the business world.

In Spring 2019, I transferred to [University at Buffalo](https://buffalo.edu) to study computer science. There, I met some wonderful people and discovered my passion for frontend development. During my senior year, I began working on [Frosty](https://frostyapp.io), my most successful project so far.

In Summer 2022, after graduating I took a few months off to continue working on Frosty and random side projects. By the end of 2022, I grew Frosty to 100,000+ downloads.

In Spring 2023, I joined the frontend engineering team at [Wildr](https://wildr.com). There, I led development of new web apps and contributed to the mobile app with multiple new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy watching streams on Twitch and playing PC games. My hobbies include collecting CS2 skins and building mechanical keyboards.
