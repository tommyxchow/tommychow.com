title: Frosty presentation slide deck

Around February, for a final interview round I was tasked with doing a 30-minute presentation on a project that I worked on and was proud of. I decided to make it about my mobile app [Frosty](https://www.frostyapp.io/). You can check out the slide deck [here](/Frosty.pdf).

It contains technical insights, challenges, metrics, and more that I hadn't really shared before. It ended up being a fun exercise that helped me improve at presentation flow, technical explanations, and visualizations. It also helped me better understand the overall impact of Frosty.

I hope you find the slides alone interesting! Almost all of the screenshots and diagrams were made with [shots.so](https://shots.so/) and [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).
