        build gaming computers, and of course play plenty of PC games (

        After graduating from high school, I began to pursue a finance degree at{' '}
        <ExternalLink href='https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/'>
          Baruch College
        </ExternalLink>{' '}
        in Fall 2018. Midway through the semester, I realized that the business
        and finance career probably wasnâ€™t for me, so I decided to transfer to
        the{' '}
        <ExternalLink href='https://www.buffalo.edu/'>
          University at Buffalo (UB)
        </ExternalLink>{' '}
        the following semester to pursue a computer science degree.
        <br />
        <br />
        Despite spontaneously transferring to a field I had no prior experience
        in, I soon realized how much I loved creatively building solutions to
        solve real problems just by sitting at my computer. I already enjoy and
        spend a lot of time sitting at my computer, so getting paid to do it as
        a career sounded cool to me. Eventually, after taking a web apps course
        (<ExternalLink href='https://cse312.com/'>CSE 312</ExternalLink>) at UB,
        I discovered my strong passion for frontend and mobile development.

        These days, I&apos;ll mostly be at my computer working on my side
        projects, watching live streams on{' '}
        <ExternalLink href='https://www.twitch.tv/'>Twitch.tv</ExternalLink>,
        and playing video games with friends.

        If you want to make me happy, your best bet is with some of my favorite
        foods. My food palette is far from unique, but I do love eating Korean
        BBQ and fried chicken, sushi, chicken over rice from halal carts, and of
        course bubble tea.
