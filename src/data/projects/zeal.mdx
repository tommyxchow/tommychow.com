## Why?

In Fall 2021 at UB, I took [CSE 442](https://catalog.buffalo.edu/courses/?abbr=CSE&num=442): a course focused on common concepts and practices in software engineering.

In the first week, we were assigned to complete a full-stack web app as a team of five by the end of the semester. We were also assigned a student project manager that would guide us using Agile common practices including sprints, scrums, and user story and task management through Kanban boards.

## The Plan

Our team founder wanted to create a web app that helped students and hackathons find teammates and relevant resources. Users would type out what they were looking for, then OpenAI would analyze and return the best matches.

For the tech stack, we chose to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for the front end and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) + [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) + [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the back end since our team wanted to learn React and had experience with Python + Flask.

The web app was to be deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) as required by the class.

## What we did

Throughout the four sprints of the project (each sprint occurred every two weeks) I was involved with a variety of tasks and responsibilities including:

- Creating and testing user stories and subtasks on ZenHub
- Designing and wireframing the prototype on Figma
- Creating interactive components and pages with React
- Setting up and deploying the project with Docker and Heroku
- Leading the team by maintaining consistent communication, assisting struggling team members, and ensuring we properly met every requirement in each sprint

We also made an end-of-semester class presentation that introduced our project in 10 minutes from a marketing perspective (i.e., pretend we were presenting to potential investors, so no developer terms).

## Result

In the end, Zeal was quite scaled from the original plan down due to us recognizing that the work and scope would be far too large for a class project. The AI part was a cool idea but excessive and unpredictable.

Despite this, we were able to achieve the highest possible grade while finishing 2 weeks before the deadline. This was a result of the excellent cooperation and skills within our team and my (impromptu) leadership.

## Key takeaways

### Experienced what being an impromptu leader is like

With Zeal, our team founder initially took the leadership role since we decided to go with his idea for the project. I and the rest of the team shortly realized that the idea, especially the AI part, was way too ambitious for a school project, so we all mutually agreed to abandon that part and scale everything down.

After this, I realized that our team was sort of in limbo. Due to the sandbox nature of the project, we all were not really sure how to proceed, and there was a brief period when communication hit its lowest point.

At this point, I decided to take the leadership role by organizing a meeting with the purpose of openly sharing and discussing our thoughts, ideas, and how to proceed. In the end, we cleared up all confusion, sparked new ideas, and were finally back on track. I’d continue to organize these meetings for the rest of the semester, greatly improving our communication and team morale.

Following our meetings, I’d occasionally check up on team members in order to verify that they were understanding their tasks correctly, have a second opinion to double-check their work, and provide any assistance if necessary. 

Prior to Zeal, I had worked on a couple of group projects but was never the actual “leader”. With common sense and an emphasis on communication, I was able to do much better than expected when taking on the role. I wanted to be as approachable, relatable, and understanding as possible, not some kind of annoying control freak. By keeping things casual with a hint of professionalism here and there, our team was able to be very cooperative, friendly, and fun to work with.

### Gained hands-on experience with Agile development

Although much different from a real-world environment, the Agile concepts we learned and used while working on Zeal gave me a better understanding of what Agile means, how it works, and why it’s widely used in the industry. Regardless of the pros and cons, I am happy to have gained exposure to it.

### Worked with front-end frameworks and libraries

Prior to this course and project, I had never really worked with React or other libraries like Bootstrap and ESLint. By working on Zeal, I was able to learn and have an eye-opening experience with these frameworks and libraries. They introduced me to the massive front-end world and community, eventually leading me to discover more awesome frameworks I’d use for future projects.

### Overcame difficulties and struggles with deployment

Probably the most difficult task I faced while working on Zeal was actually deploying the project.

I had previously deployed using Docker when working on [The Gallery](https://www.tommychow.com/projects/the-gallery), but it was a very small project with minimal dependencies. Zeal on the other hand dealt with major frameworks and tooling that I had never worked with before.

After spending a lot of time reading documentation and tutorials and plenty of trial and error, I finally managed to get it up and running on Heroku. In the end, I learned so much about DevOps best practices and concepts such as CI/CD, Docker Compose, and how web apps are built, configured, and deployed.

This also took off a huge burden on my teammates since they could focus solely on the project itself, saving us a ton of time.
