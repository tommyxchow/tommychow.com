## Why?

In Spring 2021 at UB, I took a [CSE 312](https://catalog.buffalo.edu/courses/index.php?abbr=CSE&num=312): a course focused on the fundamentals and creation of web apps, specifically full-stack development.

Along with a separate group project, we had to complete an independent full-stack project without the use of any pre-existing web server or web framework. We were allowed to choose any topic for the project as long as it satisfied all the requirements.

## The plan

Since one of the main requirements was image uploads, I decided to make a web app related to art pieces and creatively named it “The Gallery”. It would feature the ability to upload art pieces and log in/register to comment and chat.

## What I did

My last work with web apps before The Gallery was two years ago with Stock Chart Visualizer. By this time, I’d forgotten quite a few web concepts and had to relearn them.

Since we couldn’t use any frameworks, pretty much everything had to be completed manually, such as

- Building HTTP Responses (101, 200, 301, 403, 404, and binary)
- Parsing HTTP headers and multipart/form-data encoding
- The WebSocket handshake and parsing and building of WebSocket frames
- Server-side rendering of HTML web pages
- Storing and sending cookies and tokens

In order to do all of these, I had to refer to a lot of class resources and documentation including the original RFC specs.

I also wrote detailed reports explaining each part of the code and the reasonings for my decision-making.

## Result

I was able to achieve a full score on the project and finish with an A in the class.

## Key takeaways

### Changed my trajectory in computer science

Before working on The Gallery, I was in limbo with my computer science degree. I didn’t really know what I wanted to specialize in and was just going with the flow to finish my degree.

After working on The Gallery, I gained so much exposure to new technologies, frameworks, libraries, and tools. Because I read so much documentation and did a lot of Googling while working on the project, I discovered a lot of tech stacks that piqued my interest.

This would eventually lead me to become fascinated with front-end and mobile development which I now specialize in and love doing.

### Solidified my understanding of the foundations of the internet and web apps

In The Gallery, no frameworks were allowed, so we had to do pretty much everything manually. Manually building and parsing raw multipart/form-data and WebSocket frames gave me a much better understanding of how communication over the internet works.

Furthermore, by working with a server and static HTML files, I learned how interactions between clients and servers work and concepts in server-side rendering. I also learned best practices regarding security and authentication such as encrypting, hashing, and salting.

### Learned how to manually deploy with Docker

This was my first time ever deploying a web app and working with Docker, so I had so much to learn and set up in order to understand how Docker works and why its containerization is a solution for deployments.

Thanks to The Gallery, I’ve become increasingly experienced with deployment and have utilized Docker and other options in many future projects.
