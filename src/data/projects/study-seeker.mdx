## Why?

In Spring 2022 at UB, I took [CSE 370](https://catalog.buffalo.edu/courses/index.php?abbr=CSE&num=370): a course covering various frontend and UI/UX topics including responsive design, typography, style guides, usability testing, A/B testing, globalization and localization, and design patterns.

Similar to [Zeal](https://www.tommychow.com/projects/zeal) from the previous semester, we were assigned to complete a social media web app as a team of five by the end of the semester. We were also assigned a student project manager that would help us complete the project using Agile common practices including sprints, scrums, and user story and task management through Kanban boards.

## The Plan

After some discussion, our group decided to create a web app that makes it easier for students to find study buddies. It would have features such as profile pages with reviews, connections, groups, and course-specific pages.

The tech stack of the project was pre-determined and restricted by the class. We were only allowed to use pure React and CSS Modules for the front end and Swagger API for the back end.

## What we did

This time, I decided early on to take the leadership role due to my prior experience in Zeal and having the most technical expertise in the group.

Throughout the 4 sprints of the project (each sprint occurred every 2 weeks) I was involved with a variety of tasks and responsibilities which included

- Creating and testing user stories and subtasks on ZenHub
- Designing and wireframing both a mobile and desktop prototype on Figma
- Creating interactive components and pages with React
- Performing, recording, and reporting usability and A/B testing with potential users
- Generating and abiding by a style guide
- Maintaining consistent communication on our Discord server
- Ensuring we properly fulfilled every requirement in each sprint
- Directing, assisting, and teaching team members

We also completed an end-of-semester class presentation that introduced our project to peers and reflected on the entire journey.

## Result

Despite having one team member drop out in the middle of the semester, we were able to successfully complete the project and achieve an A. Not all planned features were implemented and we definitely could've improved in many areas of code readability and styling, but given the circumstances and timeframe, I was proud of what we achieved.

## Key takeaways

### Learning and applying fundamental front-end and UI/UX practices

Throughout the semester, we were required to apply the UI/UX fundamentals we learned in class to the project itself.

One of the most impactful was usability testing. In each sprint, we gathered valuable feedback from students through one-on-one interviews and walkthroughs of the website.

There was also a great emphasis on accessibility on the web, including the use of semantic HTML elements, alt attributes, color contrast, and form labels.

### Dealing with conflicts head-on

Within the team, there were several instances of conflict, uncertainty, and lack of communication, mostly with our PM. We were able to resolve all of them professionally and efficiently by having consistent meetings and one-on-ones whenever issues arise. Ensuring open and equal communication with everyone and establishing a common goal pushed us toward the finish line.

### Doing responsive web design

Prior to working on Study Seeker, I hadn’t made any websites optimized for smaller screen sizes (this was because most of my web development experience was from school projects that didn’t require responsiveness).

While working on Study Seeker, we were taught how to utilize breakpoints through CSS media queries to make the website look natural on both mobile and desktop. We were also taught to create the mobile version first before scaling up to larger screen sizes (progressive enhancement) because often adding or enlarging designs is much easier than removing or shrinking them. I still utilize this practice today and it has saved me a ton of headaches.

### Understanding that importance of vanilla CSS

When we began working on Study Seeker, I was skeptical at first because I didn’t have a ton of experience with vanilla CSS and relied on component libraries to get the job done for me.

By working on Study Seeker, I was able to learn most of the core concepts of CSS including flexbox, grid, breakpoints, box model, and positioning.

Despite some messy CSS scattered throughout, Study Seeker ended up looking surprisingly good! Now, I have a much better understanding of how CSS works and enjoy creating beautiful visual experiences with it.

It seems obvious in hindsight, but using CSS instead of component libraries gives you much more flexibility. The tradeoff is that you may spend a lot of time reworking common component patterns.
